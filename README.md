# Advanced Sling Loading

SP & MP Compatible. Full replacement for in-game sling loading.

**Features:**

All players on board a helicopter are given a "ropes" action. This lets any player deploy, extend, shorten or release cargo ropes.

Once cargo ropes are deployed, any player can go to the end of the rope and pick it up.

Once the ropes are picked up by a player, they can be attached to pretty much every object in the game.

Players can drop ropes if they're carrying them

Players on the ground can detached ropes from an object 

**Usage:**

Put **sa_ropes.sqf** in your mission directory.

Add **[] execVM "sa_ropes.sqf";** to your init.sqf file.

That's all!
